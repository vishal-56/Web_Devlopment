# Web_Devlopment
This repository is for my web development learning journey. It covers HTML, CSS, JavaScript, front-end frameworks like React, back-end development with Flask or Node.js, databases (MySQL, MongoDB), and API integration. Iâ€™ll also practice using Git. It will include notes, examples, and small projects as I grow my skills.
